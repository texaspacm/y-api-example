We do not have to do this now, but I need you to plan for adding more data to our "apartments" schema.

Right now, the schema is all about the Google+ Data.  However, we need to plan for inserting & updating data from Yelp, Instagram, and Facebook.

What do you think is the best way to add Yelp, Instagram and Facebook data to the Schema?

I was thinking we just embed another document into our current Schema.
(i will BOLD the new data)
